## Ideas
- Just create a Lambda function with default settings and choose the language you want to code in, and it give you a starter hello world template , with 2 input parameters event and context,from which event will have the input data that you pass in your test call. 


## Tips
- Use the cloud9 IDE to code the hello world Lambda initially, and then explore other deployment ideas like zip file uploads and SAM deployments
