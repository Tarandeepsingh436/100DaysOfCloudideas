## Objectives

### You need to complete the following:
- Launch an EC2 t2.micro instance with a public IP address and supply the [provided bash script](OPS04-AWS200-userdata.sh) to install a simple website with an apache server in the UserData.
- Visit the the public IP so that you are generating NetworkIn. You need
  to do this so the Metric appears selectable when create your
CloudWatch Alarm
- Create a CloudWatch Alarm and use EC2 NetworkIn as the metric
- Set your CloudWatch Alarm to use a 5 minute period
- Set your CloudWatch Alarm to a very low static threshold such as 5000
- Set the Datapoint to alarms to 3 of 4
- Try to get the Alarm to trigger an Alert state by visiting the website
  and generating NetworkIN

### You need to answer the following:
- What is a CloudWatch Alarm?
- What is a metric?
- What do we mean when we say "breach"?
- What is a threshold?
- What is a data point?
- What is a period?
- What are evaluation periods?
